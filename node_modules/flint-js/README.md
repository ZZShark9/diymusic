Views are a great abstraction on the frontend. But assembling a decent stack takes years of experience, months of building, and never-ending care.

We are *writing around our libraries* rather than having an intuitive language that understands
how we build. Flint focuses on views and functions, giving you power in simplicity.

We want to allow developers to be maximally creative.
Let's make developer experience amazing with:

 - Light abstractions that enable speed
 - Immediate feedback with helpful errors
 - Smart tooling & integration
